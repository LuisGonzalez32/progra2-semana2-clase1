    <p>Racing games are a video game genre in which the player participates in a racing competition with any type of
        land, water, air, or space vehicles. They may be based on anything from real-world racing leagues to fantastical
        settings. They are distributed along a spectrum between simulations and simplified arcade-style racing games.
        Go-kart racing games emerged in the 1990s as a popular sub-genre of the latter. Racing games may also fall under
        the category of sports games.</p>
